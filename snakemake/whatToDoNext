Next I want to modify the two scripts in this directory
so that the parse samples one outputs two things
 1) a list of all of the samples in a tsv so that things
    are easy to read for like R and stuff
 2) a yaml file that can be used as a config file for
    Snakemake with the --readfilesin {files} and 
    {readgroup} information so that I can scatter
    accross nodes on TACC
